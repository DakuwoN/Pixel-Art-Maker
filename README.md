## My process

This project really put a test to our understanding of manipulating the DOM and also using EventListeners. I would create my variables first, then I would add two event listeners beneath this, and finally I would end everything off with a function. I learned a lot in this project, I really love the idea of EventListeners, and I learned some new cool methods `.insertCell` and `.insertRow` These methods really helped me finish building the grid. 



### Built with

* HTML5
* Custom CSS Properties 
* JavaScript 

### Continued development

I want to learn more about JavaScript Event Listeners. There is much more that you can do with them, as well as maniupulation of the DOM with JavaScript!
